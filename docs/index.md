3. Try launching PixelViewer again.
4. Repeat step 1~3 until all libraries are allowed. 

### Ubuntu user
Some functions of PixelViewer depend on ```libgdiplus``` before v1.99, you may need to install ```libgdiplus``` manually to let PixelViewer runs properly:

```
apt-get install libgdiplus
```

If you want to run PixelViewer on Ubuntu (also for other Linux distributions), please grant execution permission to PixelViewer first. If you want to create an entry on desktop, please follow the steps:
1. Create a file *(name)*.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications. ex, ~/.local/share/applications/pixelviewer.desktop.
2. Open the .desktop file and put the following content:

```
[Desktop Entry]  
Name=PixelViewer  
Comment=  
Exec=(path to executable)
Icon=(path to AppIcon_128px.png in PixelViewer folder)
Terminal=false
